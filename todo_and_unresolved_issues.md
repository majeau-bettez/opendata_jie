List of things to do and unresolved issues
==========================================

TODO
----

- Clarify if subscription datasets are eligible for Data Descriptors (probably)

- Clarify open-access policy for data descriptors

- Harmonize wording for Software descriptors and Data Descriptors

- Split FAQ by topic

- Add a figure showing the mapping between APA fields and our requirements

- Add guidelines for reviewers on the minimal requirements (and badges?)



Comment from Konstantin
-----------------------

There are examples, but no definition what a *scientific repository* is. Perhaps define it as a repository which provides a DOI to an upload. Or say any repository listed in the Registry of Research Data Repositories is valid (re3data.org).


Comment from Brandon
--------------------

Try to improve wording on the whole "machine readable" and "human readable" stuff

> I think it's pretty peculiar that 'doc' and 'pdf' files are listed as neither human nor machine readable-- this is for some definition of 'readable' that is not going to be understood by most readers.  When I think of non-human-readable formats I think of, e.g. RDF or XML, even though I could certainly read them. I can't really think of any format that I would regard as neither human nor machine readable, unless we're counting binary formats for proprietary and/or obsolete software (e.g. wordperfect) (.doc is well enough supported to be human readable IMO-- are you aware of any programs that can open docx but not doc? PDF for sure is human readable). This is a corner issue. The FAQ addresses it somewhat too. but it still comes off as funny-looking.
