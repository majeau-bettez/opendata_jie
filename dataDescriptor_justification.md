New Data Section at JIE

Because IE research strives to reach a holistic system perspective, each individual study must typically connect to a broader (more generic) description of the socioeconomic metabolism beyond its immediate research focus. Consequently, IE research is particularly dependent on high quality, reusable datasets. Building and expanding structured datasets is crucial to the field of IE, as it consolidates our collective knowledge base on our industrial systems and their interactions with society and nature.

At the Journal of Industrial Ecology, we believe that IE datasets should be recognized as scientific outcomes in their own rights, independent of the multiple investigations and findings that may rely on the validity of their data. We are therefore creating a new *IE Data* section.
