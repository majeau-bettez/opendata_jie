Publication criteria
====================

Ultimately, a good descriptor should defend:

- The *novelty* of the software or dataset, compared with previous attempts/measurements
- The measures taken to ensure the *technical quality* of the software/dataset
- The potential *usefulness* and reusability of the software/dataset

In the case of software, I would add that the descriptor should:
- Show the link between the features of their software and recent methodological development; how novel methods get implemented in the software. That would link it well to the research frontier.
- Provide a demonstration of the software to show that it is mature enough to conduct research of appropriate significance for a journal article with an applied research question. The demonstration should show the novel features of the software, and input and output data should be provided alongside the submission.


A descriptor would *not* need to include a traditional research question.


Potential structure
==================

A potential recommended structure could be (again, inspired from our discussion on data descriptors):

- Title and Abstract
- Context and Background:
	- Research context, including indication of Impact
	- Need in relation to the research context.
	- Motivation for current work
- Critical review of existing software
	- Clarification of the extent to which the current submission re-uses code from these other software

- Software Features and Methods
	- Key benefits
	- Methodological description of features implemented (preferably mathematical)

- Software description (keeping it short)
	- Design principles
	- Structure
	- Main classes, methods, etc.

- Quality control and technical validation (Open discussion on whether this is for SI or not – opinions about the weight of this – if the main focus of the paper is on this, the paper should be sent to a software journal)
	- Discussion of documentation, unittest coverage, integration tests, logging, etc.
	- Transparency and readability of the code

- Current use
	- demonstration of the software for a simple case study
	- demonstration should include the “novel ability” of the software
	- input data (supporting info) and output

- Potential use and reuse
	- Key areas of application
	- Open-source?
	- Future (planned/potential) developments building on the present codebase
