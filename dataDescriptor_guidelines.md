Guidelines for Data Descriptor articles
=======================================

Each *Data Descriptor* article will focus on the methodology for building or
expanding a dataset, the different quality controls that ensure its validity,
along with the scope, properties and features of this dataset. Articles
presented to this section should not test a scientific hypothesis or present
extensive analyses aimed at answering a specific scientific question. *Rather,
the author's full attention should be dedicated to the transparent description
of the dataset's genesis and characteristics, defending the rigour of
compilation procedures and the technical quality of dataset outcomes.*

In other words, the ever more accurate, transparent and comprehensive
description of different elements of our socioeconomic metabolism becomes the
central scientific objective of articles in this Data Section. The authors are
nevertheless expected to defend the reuse value of their dataset for IE
research.


STRUCTURE
---------

-   Title and abstract
-   Dataset description

    -   Scope of dataset: what is included in the dataset and what is
        not; what dimensions were recorded
    -   Presentation of the dataset's structure, file format,
        documentation, metadata, key features, location

-   Context and background

    -   Review of previous datasets with similar scope

        -   Critical review of their strength and weaknesses, especially
            as justification for usefulness of new dataset.
        -   Clarification of level of data reuse from these datasets
            into the proposed dataset.

-   Compilation methods

    -   How the data was obtained, reconciled

-   Quality control and technical validation

    -   The analyses that were implemented to catch errors or to assess
        the overall validity of the dataset.

-   Reusability

    -   Clarification of the level of compatibility and interoperability
        with these other datasets
    -   Compatibility with analysis software

    -   Potential IE research that could be supported by this dataset


FAQ
---

### Do the reviewers check the datasets for errors?

No, not necessarily. These datasets can be huge, and asking reviewers to
vouch for their quality and manually check for individual errors would
put an undue burden on the review process. Ultimately, it is the authors
that are answerable for the quality of the proposed datasets.

### So how does the review process work?

Reviewers will evaluate the technical excellence of the procedures to
generate or compile the data; the clarity and completeness of the
dataset's documentation and metadata; the rigour of the quality controls
that were applied to these data; the appropriateness of the dataset's
structure and formatting; and the dataset's reuse value. The reviewers
may ask for additional information and may recommend further work or
rejection based on any of these points. In other words, authors must
convince the referees and editors that their dataset is of high quality
and useful to the scientific IE community.

### Is such a section only applicable to “new” datasets, or can we present
an update to an existing dataset

We encourage a cumulative consolidation of our field's knowledge, and
therefore we encourage submission of datasets that upgrade, combine and
build upon previous efforts (within the limits of copyright laws and
license agreements). The authors must convince the referees that the
improvements to the dataset are substantial and useful.

### Must I publish the dataset with the article? Under what term?

The data is at the heart of the scientific contribution of this section,
and must be made available for reuse by the community. It should
therefore be released under a public domain (C0), creative commons with
attribution (CC-BY), if necessary with a non-commercial clause
(CC-BY-NC).

**Context:** All “data journals” I reviewed release the dataset and the
datadescriptior under an Open-access license (typically CC-BY). But we
need to think of how that integrates with ISIE community and readership.

-   **Tricky question 1:** Will we make all “descriptors” in this
    section open-access, since they should accompany open data? Who pays
    for the editorial process then? Can we do that without putting a
    monetary barrier to data submission? Will our community be willing
    to pay a fee to submit data (double barrier)?
-   **Tricky question 2:** Do we want this data section to also apply to
    subscription data (ecoinvent, GaBi, etc.)? Is there not a risk that
    this becomes a “publicity/promotion” act rather than a scientific
    contribution that provides something useful to the community?

### Will JIE directly host the data?

No. That data should be archived in an approved, persistent repository.
We recommend <+xyz+>, but <+abc+> are also approved.

**Another strategic decision.** Data Briefs typically just has these
data in an “Annex” (glorified SI, simpler for the authors), while
Scientific Data tells everyone to use the big repositories (for making
the data more discoverable and regrouped).
